						<h2 align="center">Malware: worm, trojan, virus and spyware</h2>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Viruses, worms, and trojans are all part of a class of software called "malware".
						Malware is short for "malicious software", also known as malicious code or "malcode".
						It is code or software that is specifically designed to damage, disrupt, steal,
						or in general inflict some other "bad" or illegitimate action on data, hosts, or networks.<br>
						You can watch a small video as an introduction:<p>
						<center>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8mbzU0X2nQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>						
						</center>
						<p>The different types of malware are: <br>
						<ul>
							<li>Worms</li>
							<li>Trojans</li>
							<li>Viruses</li>
							<li>Spyware</li>
						</ul> <p>
						<h3 align = "center">Worms</h3>
						<p align="center">
						<img src="https://blog.emsisoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/malware-worms-blog-banner.png" height = "200">
						<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Computer worms</strong> are similar to viruses in that they replicate functional copies of themselves
						and can cause the same type of damage. In contrast to viruses, which require the spreading of an infected host file,
						worms are standalone software and do not require a host program or human help to propagate.
						To spread, worms either exploit a vulnerability on the target system or use some kind of social engineering to trick
						users into executing them. A worm enters a computer through a vulnerability in the system and takes advantage of file-transport
						or information-transport features on the system, allowing it to travel unaided. More advanced worms leverage encryption, wipers,
						and ransomware technologies to harm their targets.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Trojans</h3>
						<p align="center">
						<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Kz6fKvb/trojan-horse-virus-removal-blog-730x411.png" height = "200">
						<p style="text-align: justify">A <strong>Trojan</strong> is another type of malware named after the wooden horse that the Greeks
						used to infiltrate Troy. It is a harmful piece of software that looks legitimate. Users are typically
						tricked into loading and executing it on their systems. After it is activated, it can achieve any number
						of attacks on the host, from irritating the user (popping up windows or changing desktops) to damaging
						the host (deleting files, stealing data, or activating and spreading other malware, such as viruses).
						Trojans are also known to create backdoors to give malicious users access to the system. Unlike viruses
						and worms, Trojans do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate. Trojans must
						spread through user interaction such as opening an email attachment or downloading and running a file
						from the Internet.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Viruses</h3>
						<p align="center">				
						<img src="https://www.a2secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/computer-virus.jpg" height = "200">
						<p style="text-align: justify">A <strong>computer virus</strong> is a type of malware that propagates by inserting a copy 
						of itself into and becoming part of another program. It spreads from one computer to another, leaving infections as it travels.
						Viruses can range in severity from causing mildly annoying effects to damaging data or software and causing denial-of-service
						(DoS) conditions. Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means the virus may exist on a system but will
						not be active or able to spread until a user runs or opens the malicious host file or program. When the host code is executed,
						the viral code is executed as well. Normally, the host program keeps functioning after it is infected by the virus. However,
						some viruses overwrite other programs with copies of themselves, which destroys the host program altogether. Viruses spread
						when the software or document they are attached to is transferred from one computer to another using the network, a disk,
						file sharing, or infected email attachments.
						from the Internet.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Spyware</h3>
						<center>
						<img src="https://www.le-vpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/What-is-spyware-1200x628.png" height = "200">
						</center>			
						<p style="text-align: justify">Spyware is a type of malicious software -- or malware -- that is installed on a computing
						device without the end user's knowledge.
						It invades the device, steals sensitive information and internet usage data, and relays it to advertisers, data firms or
						external users.
						Any software can be classified as spyware if it is downloaded without the user's authorization.
						Spyware is controversial because, even when it is installed for relatively innocuous reasons, it can violate the end user's privacy
						and has the potential to be abused.
						Spyware is one of the most common threats to internet users. Once installed, it monitors internet activity,
						tracks login credentials and spies on sensitive information. The primary goal of spyware is usually to obtain credit card numbers,
						banking information and passwords.<br>
						Spyware can be difficult to detect; often, the first indication a user has that a computing device has been infected with spyware
						is a noticeable reduction in processor or network connection speeds and -- in the case of mobile devices --
						data usage and battery life. Antispyware tools can be used to prevent or remove spyware.
						Antispyware tools can either provide real-time protection by scanning network data and blocking malicious data,
						or they can detect and remove spyware already on a system by executing scans.</p>
						<h2 align="center">Software and hardware to protect networks</h2>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">Network Security protects your network and data from breaches,
						intrusions and other threats. This is a vast and overarching term that describes hardware and
						software solutions as well as processes or rules and configurations relating to network use,
						accessibility, and overall threat protection.<br>
						Network Security involves access control, virus and antivirus software, application security,
						network analytics, types of network-related security (endpoint, web, wireless), firewalls, VPN encryption and more.<br>
						To deter cyberattacks and hacking attempts, a total of three types of network security components can be called upon
						– hardware, software, and cloud security components.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Hardware security components</h3>
						<center>
						<img src="https://www.networkstraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hardwarefirewalls.jpg" height = "200">
						</center>								
						<p style="text-align: justify">Hardware components include servers and devices that perform an array of security
						operations within a network. Hardware components can be set up in two ways:<br>
						<ul>
							<li style="text-align: justify">Out of the path of network traffic (“out-of-line”): Operating as a separate entity from network traffic,
								out-of-line security appliances are tasked with monitoring traffic and raising alerts when they detect malicious data.</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify">In the path of network traffic (“in-line”): A more popular option of the two, in-line hardware appliances are
							tasked with directly blocking data packets the moment they run into potential threats.</li>
						</ul> <p>
						<h3 align = "center">Software security components</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Security software components are installed on devices across the network,
						providing added detection capabilities and threat remediation. The far most common form of software
						network security components are antivirus applications.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Software components</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Security software components are installed on devices across the network,

						network security components are antivirus applications.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Cloud security components</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Finally, cloud services entail offloading the security infrastructure
						onto a cloud provider. The protection strategy is similar to in-line hardware appliances as all the
						network traffic goes through the cloud provider. While there, the traffic gets scanned for potential
						threats before either being blocked or allowed into the network.</p>
						
						
						<h2 align="center">Network protocols: SSL, HTTPS, IPv6</h2>
						<center>
						<img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/researchreports/thumbnails/network-protocol-definition.jpg?sfvrsn=719a2da0_0" height = "200">
						</center>								
						<p style="text-align: justify">A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data
						is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices
						to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure
						or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world,
						and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.<br>
						Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network
						protocols make it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built
						into devices’ software and hardware. Neither local area networks (LAN) nor wide area networks (WAN) could
						function the way they do today without the use of network protocols.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">SSL</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its now-deprecated predecessor,
						Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security
						over a computer network. Several versions of the protocols are widely used in applications such as email,
						instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use as the Security layer in HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.
						The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.<br>
						The TLS protocol comprises two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols. TLS is a proposed Internet Engineering
						Task Force (IETF) standard, first defined in 1999, and the current version is TLS 1.3 defined in August 2018.
						TLS builds on the earlier SSL specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by Netscape
						Communications for adding the HTTPS protocol to their Navigator web browser.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">HTTPS</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
						It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.
						[In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or,
						formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">IPv6</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify">Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol
						(IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and
						routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the
						long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. In December 1998, IPv6 became
						a Draft Standard for the IETF, who subsequently ratified it as an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.<br>
						Devices on the Internet are assigned a unique IP address for identification and location definition.
						With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far
						more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998,
						the IETF had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, theoretically allowing 2128,
						or approximately 3.4×1038 addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved
						for special use or completely excluded from use. The two protocols are not designed to be interoperable,
						and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several
						transition mechanisms have been devised to rectify this.</p>					
						<h2 align="center">Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h2>
						<center>
						<img src="https://www.edicomgroup.com/edicom-connecting-business/certification-authority/what_is/main/01/contentImage_en_ESScaledMax/contentImageGrande_en_ES.jpg" height = "200">
						</center>								
						<p style="text-align: justify">Digital certificates are issued by trusted parties, called certificate
						authorities, to verify the identity of an entity, such as a client or server.<br>
						The digital certificate	serves two purposes: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available.
						It is issued with an expiration date, after which it is no longer guaranteed by the certificate authority (CA).<br>
						To obtain a digital certificate, you send a request to the CA of your choice, such as Verisign, or RSA.
						The request includes your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature.
						A distinguished name (DN) is a unique identifier for each user or host for which you are applying for a certificate.
						The CA checks your signature using your public key and performs some level of verification of your identity
						(this varies with different CAs). After verification, the CA sends you a signed digital certificate that
						contains your distinguished name, your public key, the CA's distinguished name, and the signature of the
						certificate authority. You store this signed certificate in your key database.</p>
