						<p style="text-align: justify">Viruses, worms, and trojans are all part of a class of software called "malware".
						Malware is short for "malicious software", also known as malicious code or "malcode".
						It is code or software that is specifically designed to damage, disrupt, steal,
						or in general inflict some other "bad" or illegitimate action on data, hosts, or networks.<br>
						You can watch a small video as an introduction:<p>

						<p>The different types of malware are: <br>
						<ul>
							<li>Worms</li>
							<li>Trojans</li>
							<li>Viruses</li>
							<li>Spyware</li>
						</ul> <p>
						<h3 align = "center">Worms</h3>
						<p align="center">

						<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Computer worms</strong> are similar to viruses in that they replicate functional copies of themselves
						and can cause the same type of damage. In contrast to viruses, which require the spreading of an infected host file,
						worms are standalone software and do not require a host program or human help to propagate.
						To spread, worms either exploit a vulnerability on the target system or use some kind of social engineering to trick
						users into executing them. A worm enters a computer through a vulnerability in the system and takes advantage of file-transport
						or information-transport features on the system, allowing it to travel unaided. More advanced worms leverage encryption, wipers,
						and ransomware technologies to harm their targets.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Trojans</h3>
						<p align="center">
						<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Kz6fKvb/trojan-horse-virus-removal-blog-730x411.png" height = "200">
						<p style="text-align: justify">A <strong>Trojan</strong> is another type of malware named after the wooden horse that the Greeks
						used to infiltrate Troy. It is a harmful piece of software that looks legitimate. Users are typically
						tricked into loading and executing it on their systems. After it is activated, it can achieve any number
						of attacks on the host, from irritating the user (popping up windows or changing desktops) to damaging
						the host (deleting files, stealing data, or activating and spreading other malware, such as viruses).
						Trojans are also known to create backdoors to give malicious users access to the system. Unlike viruses
						and worms, Trojans do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate. Trojans must
						spread through user interaction such as opening an email attachment or downloading and running a file
						from the Internet.</p>
						<h3 align = "center">Viruses</h3>
						<p align="center">				
						<img src="https://www.a2secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/computer-virus.jpg" height = "200">
						<p style="text-align: justify">A <strong>computer virus</strong> is a type of malware that propagates by inserting a copy 
						of itself into and becoming part of another program. It spreads from one computer to another, leaving infections as it travels.
						Viruses can range in severity from causing mildly annoying effects to damaging data or software and causing denial-of-service
						(DoS) conditions. Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means the virus may exist on a system but will
						not be active or able to spread until a user runs or opens the malicious host file or program. When the host code is executed,
						the viral code is executed as well. Normally, the host program keeps functioning after it is infected by the virus. However,
						some viruses overwrite other programs with copies of themselves, which destroys the host program altogether. Viruses spread
						when the software or document they are attached to is transferred from one computer to another using the network, a disk,
						file sharing, or infected email attachments.
						from the Internet.</p>
